Tech:
Adding the Node/Express server and Angular frontend template to begin work on site.

After cloning app, add to .gitignore file on line 8:
backend/secrets.js

To run app:
install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Install Bower (https://bower.io/)
Install nodemon (https://github.com/remy/nodemon)
On a terminal navigate to the project's folder and run 'npm install'
On same terminal run 'bower install'
On same terminal run 'nodemon server.js'
navigate to http://localhost:4141/ and if everything went well you'll be able to see the app running there.
